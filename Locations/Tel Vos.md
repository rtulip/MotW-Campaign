# Tel Vos

## overview
Tel Vos is a Telvanni tower just to the North West of [Vos](Vos.md). The Telvanni used to govern [Vos](Vos.md), but have locked themselves into their fortress since the Calamity. Tel Vos itself has been shielded from the outside world through a series of defensive barriers. Silencing shields have been placed around the exterior of the fortress to prevent distraction from the town below. 

The fortress has one major entrance, a stone archway where a pair of wooden doors keep the fortress closed. Just past the entrance, there is a large courtyard. At the center of the courtyard, a massive mushroom spire leans out towards the Northern walls. The spire continues up, spiraling around a tower in the corner before returning towards the center of the complex yet again. At the top of the spire, a small cirular door can be seen leading into the mushroom itself.

The outer wall of the fortress has smaller mushroom sprouts weaving in and out of the stone brick. There are 2 doors leading into the walls, which contain sleeping and storage areas for the Telvanni.
