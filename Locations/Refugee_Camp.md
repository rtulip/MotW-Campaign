# Refugee Camp

## Overview
Just to the South of [Vos](Vos.md), roughly 20-25 refugees have set up camp. Tents have been set up just outside the town limits on the backs of the fortified fence. The length of the camp is roughly 5-6 tents wide, and a circle has begun to form around a central meeting area and fire pit. A large fire continues to burn in the center of the camp, keeping the local area slightly more comfortable. a collection of pelts and leathers have been set up between the tents, creating a covered area under the main fire.
