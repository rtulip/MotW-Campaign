# Docks

## Overview
To the East of [Vos](Vos.md) are the Docks at the shore of the Sea of Ghosts. The Docks themselves are constructed from mushroom platformes that stretch out overthe water like tentacles. Most of the dock space is occupied by small row boats and fishing boats. One large platform has been reserved for larger ships that would normally harbor the ferries that would bring people up and down the coast.

### Store Room
Just on the shore at the foot of the docks is a store room. [Baraen](../NPC/Baraen.md), the supply master works here. He takes inventory of what's in stock, what is in short supply, and what goes missing.

The room itself consists of a [Baraen](../NPC/Baraen.md)'s Desk to the right of the entrance and a few rows of shelves housing line, rope, and traps. In the corners, there are a few burlap sacks containing flours, potatoes, and other foods which dont go off quickly. 

### People who can be found at the docks:
* [Baraen](../NPC/Baraen.md)
* [Orthyl](../NPC/Orthyl.md)
* [Nespia](../NPC/Nespia.md) and other guards
* Other fisherman and such
