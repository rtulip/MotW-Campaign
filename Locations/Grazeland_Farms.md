# Grazeland Farms

## Overview
Since the Calamity, the Temple has been looking for ways to keep spirits high in the village of [Vos](Vos.md). Over the past few months, [Madres](../NPC/Madres.md) and [Sabine](../NPC/Sabine.md) have been organizing the resoration of the Grazelands just to the north of [Vos](Vos.md). At this point, the land is just fertile enough to grow Wickwheat, which allows a few people to get to work.

Walking to and from [Vos](Vos.md), the ground transisions from a dead and infertile soil with no life, to a slightly more green area with small patches of grasses and small shrubs starting to grow again. The farms themselves are almost ready to be harvested, and are mostly looking healthy. There is a small patch missing from the fields because of the [Daedrat](../Monsters/Daedrat.md) encounter the players had in the first session of the campain.

### People who can be found here
* [Sabine](../NPC/Sabine.md) would be working in the fields or on the land
* [Norbis](../NPC/Norbis.md) would be watching over the workers and trying to escape most of the town
* Some farmers
