Er-Ei - Random Argonian
	- Players met him in the Celler Keg.
	- He was an enslaved argonian who's master died in the cataclysm. 
	- Isn't really sure what to do with himself. 
	- "Issar Maverick" (Luther) bought him a drink, and left him alone.
		- It was a bit of a revelation to see another of a beast race stand so tall and be so kind as to pay attention to him, and then leave him alone. 
	
	- He immediately trusts Issar, and will probably see if he can get into shenannigans with him,
