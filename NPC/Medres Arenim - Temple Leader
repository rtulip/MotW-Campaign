Madres Arenim - Leader of the temple:

	MAJOR CHARACTER
	
	Worships the Good Gods:
		Azura: Sees the changes
		Boethiah: Ruler of deciept, conspiracy, plots, treason
		Mephala: Mortals are a weave, pull one thread and it all unravels	

	His interpretation of the Gods:
		Change is inevitable, and constant, thus its not worth trying to go against the change Azura sets in motion.  
		The current change is good for him. With the destruction of every other temple on the island, he has an oppertunity to prove himself to the New Temple.
	
	His feeling towards the refugees:
		He wants them to be well, but he doesn't want to get to know anyone really.
		A couple people have been arrested for the chaos they've started to cause in the town since getting there. His prison is set up in a makeshift in the basement. 
		Wants to find people who can be of use to him, so he doesn't have 
	
	his philosophies;
		Ends justify means. Change is going to happen, and lies, plots murder are all acceptable ways to further the plans of Azura
		
	His goals:
		Want's to be recognized by the New Temple. The new organization has a power gap at the top of the system. He hasn't had any influence until this point because of the location where he's been working. 
		Wants to keep the people of the village safe, because Azura clearly wants them to be.
		Doesn't want to do any dirty work himself. Enlists his underling
		
	Feeling towards the Telvanni:
		Conflicted. on one hand their magic clearly helped save the himself, and the village
					On the other hand, they've completely neglected everyone in Vos for the past 6 months
		
	Feeling towards the players:
		David: Apethetic. Doesn't really know what to do with him. He's been there for years, has helped, but clearly is dabbling with daedric rituals
		Connor & Ben: Initially, not trustworthy.
