Players investigated the corpse and the local area
	- Figured out that the daedrat came from somewhere in the northwest
	- Only saw the trail of one, but know that they normally come in packs
	- Figured out that the eyes make them hard to focus on 
		- Could lead to interesting story elements where the rats can stare you down and make you forget about them. 
	
Returned to the temple. 
	- Madres thanked them
		- Players thought he didn't react all to severely to finding out a daedric rat is around.
	- Madres offered the the players a more formal inivation to work for them. 
		- Agreed to pay the players in weapons, armors, and magic for helping them
	
	*** Luther and Todd seem suspicious of Madres
		- What exactly is all the paperwork?
		- There's only 70ish people and no proper government structure. What is all of it for?

Players agreed to look for whatever is going on with the rats
	- Todd & Luter had a bit of a bnoding moment, realizing they're ok getting up to trouble
	- Got into a bit of a hissy fit with each other, and ended up drawing weapons 
		- Got interrupted by Norbis - an overwhelmed guard who got hissed at by Luter

Braccus has started looking for his student
	- Asked Sabine about him
		- Said she hasn't seen him in a while	
	- Asked Madres to look out for him
		- Got no reply

Players went down to the Celler Keg to see if Braccus' student was there
	- No sign

Players hung around at the bar to talk to locals and see if shady shit is going on
	- Met Er-Ei freed by circumstance argonian slave
		- Shy, quiet in the corner sitting by himself
	- Met Vindskar - Nord Fisherman who led them on to things being taken and going missing on the docks

Players went down to the docks
	Todd & Braacus entered the storeroom, and were faced by a very confused reguard - Baraen.
	Braacus started asking for some help and explaining who he was when Todd interrupted
	
	Was instructed that Madres needed him up at the temple immediately. Todd convinced him that he'd watch overthe storeroom for him, and he has run off to the temple.
