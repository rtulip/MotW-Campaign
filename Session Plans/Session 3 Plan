Start of session:

	SET A TIMER FOR 20 MINS!!!!!!	
	
	Pick up where we left off. Baraen has just left the dock storeroom and the players have been left alone there. Players are looking for more evidence of the daedrats.

	Describe the storeroom, and let them start looking around.
	Can probably find clues leading to the northwest	

at 20 mins:
	If players are still in the storeroom, Baraen will return and be very confused?
		* Madres didn't need him right then, but was able to talk a little bit about why he was sent, who he saw, 
			* Notably only two of them - Todd & Braccus
			* Madres is much less trusting of "Arthur"  - Will probably send assistant to spy on him in a future session.
	
	If players aren't there:
		* Baraen will become very suspicious of the cast and start to track them down after locking up the storeroom
		* Baraen will also have returned to Madres to inform them that they are gone. 
			* Further distrust from Madres
